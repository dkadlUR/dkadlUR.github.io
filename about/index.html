	<div class="blurb">
	<p>I am a seasoned law enforcement veteran with over three decades of experience patrolling the gritty borderlands between the United States and Mexico. Known for my unyielding pursuit of justice, I have cracked some of the toughest cases in the region, often relying on my razor-sharp intuition and a network of trusted informants. A no-nonsense captain who bends the rules to get results, I embody the old-school grit of police work, fighting corruption and crime with an iron fist. Outside the badge, I enjoy a quiet life with my loyal cane and a stiff drink, always ready to share war stories from the front lines.</p>
